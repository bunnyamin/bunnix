# DEFAULT CONFIGURATION
# The default ruleset enforces a complete lockdown of connections. It is
# intended to be enforced before network connection and later extended by other
# rulesets.
#
# The purpose is to ensure complete security if the extended ruleset for any
# reason fails to start.

# Require: IP forwarding
# systemd `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`

# Clear any previous ruleset.
